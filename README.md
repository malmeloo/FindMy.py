The current "Find My-scene" is quite fragmented, with code
being all over the place across multiple repositories,
written by [several authors](#Credits). This project aims to
unify this scene, providing common building blocks for any
application wishing to integrate with the Find My network.

## ü§ù Contributing

Want to contribute code? That's great! For new features, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/issues) first so we can discuss.

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting.
Before opening a pull request, please ensure that your code adheres to these rules.
There are pre-commit hooks included to help you with this, which you can set up as follows:

```shell
pip install uv
uv sync  # this installs ruff & pre-commit into your environment
pre-commit install
```

After following the above steps, your code will be linted and formatted automatically
before committing it.
